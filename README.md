VAudience test app
Fitness app for working exercises with flutter without any special package.
We have 4 pages:
- Welcome Page (loading app and preparing data)
- Configuration Page (Motivation quote and inserting number of sequences how many
durations are for working sequence and how many duration is for break sequence
and user is able to start app)
- Working Page (Show you time and countdown in seconds and show are you on
working or break sequence and which one sequence is in progress you are able to
start or stop your timer, showing you in round one working one break interval)
- Done Page (you have DONE message and you can go again on Configuration page
and start new session)
Tasks from document:
- User is able to insert :- number of training intervals, - duration of each training
interval, - duration of each break interval
- User is then able to start the training session.
- A timer counts down the remaining time (in seconds) during any interval.
- Each training session can be paused/resumed and stopped.
- Please make sure the user of the app is able to differentiate between training and
break intervals by using different background colors for example.
- Above the timer the app should display the training interval/round number he/she is
currently in.
- Displayed motivation message
Using last version of flutter and all packages is ‘homemade’ you have icons for all versions
of device and I show you how I work with components, gradient, assets and other stuff. You
have restrictions on app and if you dont input a numbers you will get modal with message
